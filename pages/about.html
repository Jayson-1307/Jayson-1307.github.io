            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I started learning to code, I've been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems. 
                I am a second-year Software Engineering student at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam, and I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in software development.
                Before starting my current studies, I completed a level 4 MBO (Secondary Vocational Education) program in Software Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in web development, focusing on building efficient, user-friendly applications. 
                My journey started with creating simple websites, and I am now developing more complex projects, 
                including responsive web applications using technologies like <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript (Lit and Vue) and Java (Sprintboot)</span>.

          <h3>Internship Experience</h3>
          <p>
              During my MBO course, I had two internships where I gained hands-on experience in software development. 
              I'll tell you more about my experiences during my internships.
          </p>

          <h5>First internship - software developer (full stack) - Februari 2022-July 2022</h5>
          <p>
            During my first internship, I focused on both front-end and back-end development while working in an agile (Scrum) environment. 
            I used HTML/CSS with SASS or LESS as pre-processors, depending on the project requirements, 
            and Bootstrap as a framework. Additionally, I worked with JavaScript, including some jQuery and AJAX, for specific projects. 
            Finally, I used PHP and SQL to interact with the database and integrated Gutenberg components into WordPress to make them dynamic.
          </p>

          <h5>Second internship - Front-end developer - Februari 2023-July 2023</h5>
          <p>During my second internship, I focused solely on front-end development. 
            During this time, I delved deeper into creating dynamic and responsive web applications. 
            I used HTML/CSS with LESS as a pre-processor and Bootstrap as a framework. 
            Additionally, I used JavaScript to make the website dynamic and interactive. 
            I worked directly with customers to ensure the website met their expectations. 
            Again, I worked in an agile (Scrum) environment, which I really enjoyed.
          </p>

          <p>
              These experiences have given me a solid understanding of the software development lifecycle 
              and taught me the value of collaboration and communication in a team environment.
